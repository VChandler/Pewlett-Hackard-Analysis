# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview
In the organization, we are aware of a potentially upcoming flood of retirees which may critically impact the operations and future of the firm without proper planning.  In order to better understand this, the first phase of this project (already completed) was to gather the raw data and add it to a database.  In this phase, we built a number of SQL queries to gather data and insights for two purposes:
* Determine the number of retiring employees per title
* Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program  
## Results  
### Number of retiring employees per title  
In examining employees that were born between 1952 and 1955 (high likelihood of retiring soon), there is a substantial brain drain that will be occurring:

* The grand total of this group is 90,398, which represents 38% of the company's employees.
* Between Asst, Engineer, and Sr Engineers, potentially 45,397 engineers could be retiring soon.  At present, that also represents about 38% of the company's engineers.
* Out of 9 current managers, 2 are nearing retirement, which will place significant stress on leadership within the organization

To help fill this void of technical and people leadership, we have conducted an analysis to show that 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.  The data for this group is found in the "mentorship_eligibility.csv" in the github repository.  This group consists of a number of different titles:

## Summary  
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
